## How am I generated?
Based on *SwiftSyntax*, the renderer walks through the directories and analyzes the syntax of each solution to fetch its metadata.

For example, it can collect the tag info if the following statement appears in the solution:

```swift
let tags: [Tag] = [.marked, .dp, .graph]
```
